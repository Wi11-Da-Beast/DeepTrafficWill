# DeepTrafficWill
This is my attempt at MIT's DeepTraffic challenge. If you're interested in learning more head over to https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic/ and try your hand at it.

While building this, my goal has been to create an agent which can dive as fast as possible with as little input as possible. I have been able to reach 74.31mph on average while only looking at seven blocks around me. This has real world benefits since it reduces the number of (expensive) sensors that need to be added to a car in order to add self driving capibilities. It is also helpful since it limits the number of irrelivent patterns for the program to 'percieve'.
Although I tried to add a convolutional layer to the program, I found, to my surprise, that it did not raise the top speed.
If anyone has a way to improve my code feel free to reach out and I'd be glad to hear how I can develop it. Additionally, if anyone can impliment a convolutional layer which improves the program I would be thrilled so definitly reach out serounding that as well.
