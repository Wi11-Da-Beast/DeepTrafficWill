# DeepTrafficWill
This is my attempt at MIT's DeepTraffic challenge. If you're interested in learning more head over to https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic/ and try your hand at it.

While building this, my goal has been to create an agent which can dive as fast as possible with as little input as possible. I have been able to reach 74.33mph on average while only looking at seven blocks around me.
Although I tried to add a convolutional layer to the program, I found, to my surprise, that it did not raise the top speed.
If anyone has a way to improve my code feel free to reach out and I'd be glad to hear how I can develop it. Additionally, if anyone can impliment a convolutional layer which improves the program I would be thrilled so definitly reach out serounding that as well.
